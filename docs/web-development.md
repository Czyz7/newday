## How is a website built with code different than CMS platforms?

Websites built with `Code` drastically differ from websites built with [CMS](/docs/cms-build/) platforms.

Though very reliable, [CMS](/docs/cms-build/) websites cannot handle the traffic websites built with code can.

They may be easier to manage and maintain when something breaks, but fall short in nearly every other category.

_**Without exception**_, every major company's website is developed with `coding`.

This is ideal for companies that are transitioning from a small-business to a large business level.
