# SEO Optimization

## What is SEO?

SEO stands for `Search Engine Optimization`.

Like most practices on the web today, it is an artform.

Also, it is _**necessary**_ in this era in increasing your reach of customers and clients.

:::danger Warning

No SEO expert or professional can truly deliver on the promise that they can get your website to hit the top 10 on Google, or any other search engine.

You should know that his is a red flag and unfortunately this person/company is likely a scammer.

Without getting into the boring jargon, there are keywords that every website does or doesn't have behind the scenes.

These keywords drive traffic to your website and potentially increase sales/business for your company.

### Is there a way to "work around the system" and "hack" my way to the top?

At Accessible Web Designs, none of our team members practice these methods.

Yet, _**unfortunately**_, there are.

People who do employ these malicious and risky techniques are "Black Hatted" sooner rather than later.

This can lead to penalties, permanent bans, and even have your website indefinitely removed from a search engine.

## Where do you Optimize SEO?

Behind the scenes within the source code.

Even if your website is built with a [CMS](/docs/cms-build/) platform, there are numerous plugins that can help with the SEO process.

To be fair, it is more difficult and expensive to apply SEO to [CMS](/docs/cms-build/) platforms, as there are far more moving parts involved with accessing the deeper levels.

---

## How does this benefit my site?

An increase in traffic gives your website the opportunity to have an increase in clients and sales.

Image and link optimization quickens loading times, which in turn entices users to browse and see every nook and cranny your website has to offer.

Take it from `Amazon`, `Apple`, `Netflix`, `Facebook` and other big name websites.

A faster website means a happier user experience.

When users are happy with consuming your content, they are more likely to tell their friends and increase your customer base.

## Is SEO necessary for my business?

If you want to get ahead of the curve and give your business the greatest possible chance to succeed, than you need to consider SEO for your website.

Though you&apos;re already at a high level with your business' website, who wouldn&apos;t want to reach a higher level through utilizing cutting edge optimization techniques.
